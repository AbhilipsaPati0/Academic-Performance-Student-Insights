# Academic Performance & Student Insight 

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Semester 5 academic performance data to generate batch-level and student-level insights. Excel is used for data preparation and Power BI for interactive visualization, enabling grade distribution analysis, subject-wise risk identification, student recommendations, and individual student grade lookup.

## Objectives
- Analyze overall grade distribution
- Identify subject-wise academic risk (D + F)
- Determine students recommended for the 1-year project paper
- Segment students by performance consistency
- Enable student-wise grade lookup via Registration Number

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, aggregation)
- Power BI (interactive dashboards, slicers, KPIs)

## Dataset
Fields include:
- Reg_No
- Name
- Subject_Name
- Type
- Credits
- Grades (O, E, A, B, C, D, F, R)

## Dashboard Features
1. Grade Distribution (Donut Chart)
2. Subject-wise Academic Risk (Bar Chart)
3. KPI Cards (Total Students, Recommended Students)
4. Performance Segmentation (High / Average / Needs Improvement)
5. Student Grade Lookup (Reg_No-based search)

## Key Insights
- E and O grades dominate overall performance
- Academic risk is concentrated in specific subjects
- Many students qualify for project recommendation
- Performance ratios identify consistent top performers

## Impact
- Supports data-driven academic decisions
- Identifies focus areas for intervention
- Demonstrates end-to-end analytics skills

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-semester trend analysis
- Predictive performance modeling
- Role-based dashboard views
